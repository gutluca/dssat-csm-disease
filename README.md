## Abstract

This repository contains a modified version of the [DSSAT](https://dssat.net/) (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) source code, integrating a generic epidemiological model for foliar fungal diseases into the CROPGRO template plant growth module.

The new module, **DISMO** - Disease Impact and Severity Module (`DISEASE_LEAF` subroutine), simulates the progression of leaf diseases such as Asian Soybean Rust (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*) using a daily cohort-based state-transition model. It calculates diseased leaf area from environmental drivers and pathogen dynamics, and reduces canopy photosynthesis via the existing Generic-Pest (`PEST`) module.

The module is activated by a single switch in the DSSAT experiment file (FILEX): **`ISWDIS = 'Y'`**.
DISMO will only activate if  ISWDIS = 'Y' AND the input file (disease_parameters.txt) is in the current simulation directory
(for example: if you are simulating soybean, the input parameters should be in 'C:\DSSAT48\Soybean').

> **Architecture note (March 2026):** `DISMO.for` was moved from `Plant\CROPGRO` to `Plant\Generic-Pest` and is now invoked exclusively through the **Generic-Pest (`PEST`) module**. No direct calls to `DISEASE_LEAF` remain in `CROPGRO.for`.

## Scientific Background

### 1. The Epidemiological Model (`DISEASE_LEAF` — `DISMO.for`)

The model follows a **cohort-based polycyclic approach**. Each day a new cohort of latent spores is deposited on the canopy; cohorts progress through latency, become infectious, sporulate, and die according to temperature-driven rates. Secondary inoculum produced by infectious cohorts creates new latent cohorts, resulting in the exponential epidemic growth typical of rust pathogens.

#### Disease Cycle — Processes and Functions

| Step | Function | Formula / Logic |
|---|---|---|
| Canopy spore capacity | `F_CANSPO` | `FSS = min(LAI / (NDS × LESION_S), 1)` |
| Spore deposition | `F_DS` | `DS = FSS × NDS` |
| Infection rate | `F_IR` | `IR = Ymax × FT × (1 − exp(−(A × LWD)^B))` |
| Latent spores per cohort | `F_LS` | `LS = IR × DS` |
| Latency progress rate | `F_LR` | `LR = FT_D / LDmin` |
| Latent → infectious | cohort loop | when cumulative `LR >= 1`, cohort becomes infectious |
| Lesion aging rate | `F_LAR` | `Lesion_Rate = FT_D / LESLIFEMAX` |
| Sporulation shape | `F_LAF` | Triangular: rises to 1 at `LESIONAGEOPT`, falls to 0 at age = 1 |
| Secondary inoculum | `F_PPSR_POP` | Verhulst logistic in population space; spores per unit infectious area |
| Virtual lesion factor | `F_VIRTUAL_LESIONS` | `fvl = (1 − s)^β`, where `s = NEW_LOSS_TODAY / HEALTH_LAI` |

#### Temperature Response

Two independent **beta-shaped** responses are computed from daily mean temperature `T = (Tmax + Tmin) / 2`:

- **`FT_G`** — spore germination, parameterised by `TMIN_G`, `TOT_G`, `TMAX_G`
- **`FT_D`** — general fungal development (latency, aging, sporulation), parameterised by `TMIN_D`, `TOT_D`, `TMAX_D`
- **`FT = FT_G × FT_D`** — combined response used for the infection rate

#### Leaf Wetness Duration

`LWD` (hours, 0–24) is derived from relative humidity via a logistic function:

```
LWD = 31.31 / (1 + exp(-((RH − 85.17) / 9.13)))
```

When `USE_WTH_RH = .TRUE.` (default), `RH` comes directly from the DSSAT weather file. When `.FALSE.`, `RH` is computed internally from an empirical dew-point formula using `Tmin` and `Tmax`.

#### Healthy LAI Tracking

At each `RATE` call, healthy LAI is computed as:

```
HEALTH_LAI = max(LAI_TOTAL − LAI_INF_LIST(DAE−1), 0)
```

where `LAI_INF_LIST` is the cumulative removed LAI array updated daily. New infectious cohorts can only occupy remaining healthy area (`HEALTH_LAI_AVAIL`), preventing the model from exceeding the physical leaf area.

#### Virtual Lesion Effect on Photosynthesis

The virtual lesion concept (Primiano & Amorim, 2020) accounts for the physiological impairment of still-green tissue surrounding necrotic lesions:

1. `s = NEW_LOSS_TODAY / HEALTH_LAI` — daily fraction of newly necrosed leaf area
2. `fvl = (1 − s)^β` — `β` is read from the parameter file; higher values = stronger reduction
3. `VPHOTF_DISMO = fvl` is stored via `PUT('PLANT','VPHOTF',...)` and applied to `PGAVL` inside `ASMDM` in `PEST.for`

---

### 2. Fungicide Decision Module

An optional rule-based fungicide model, toggled by `USE_FUNGICIDE` in `DISMO.for` (default `.FALSE.`):

| Component | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Risk index (DVIP) | 0–3 per day | Gaussian function of `LWD` and `T` (Beruski et al., 2020) |
| Spray trigger | `SUM7 >= 6` AND `HEALTH_LAI >= 0.1` | 7-day rolling DVIP sum exceeds threshold with sufficient canopy |
| Buffer period | 16 days | Minimum interval between consecutive sprays |
| Residual protection | 14 days | Efficacy window after each application |
| Efficacy | `FUNG_EFFICIENCY = 0.723` | Proportional reduction in `IR` during residual period |

When `USE_FUNGICIDE = .FALSE.`, spray decisions are still tracked (for diagnostics in the output file), but the infection rate is not reduced.

---

### 3. Integration Architecture

#### Previous architecture (before March 2026)

`DISEASE_LEAF` was called **directly inside `CROPGRO.for`** at every simulation phase (`RUNINIT`, `RATE`, `INTEGR`, `OUTPUT`, `SEASEND`). State arrays (`ESP_LAT_HIST`, `SUP_INF_LIST`, `LAI_INF_LIST`) and weather variables were declared locally in `CROPGRO.for`. The `VIRTUAL_PHOTO_FACTOR` was also applied there directly as `PGAVL = PGAVL * VIRTUAL_PHOTO_FACTOR`.

#### Current architecture

`DISEASE_LEAF` is called **exclusively inside `PEST.for`**. `CROPGRO.for` calls `PEST` unchanged — only minimal additions were made to CROPGRO (`PUT` calls for `XLAID`, `NVEG0D`, `YREMGD`, `YRENDD`, and the `ISWDIS='Y'` condition in the `PEST` call guard).

```
CROPGRO.for
  └── CALL PEST(...)                           ← ISWDIS = 'Y'
        └── PEST.for
              ├── [RUNINIT]   IF RUN_DISMO → CALL DISEASE_LEAF(RUNINIT)
              ├── [SEASINIT]  IF ISWDIS='Y' → CALL IPPROG (classic time-series)
              │               CALL PESTCP / ASMDM / SEEDDM / VEGDM / ROOTDM / OPPEST
              │               IF RUN_DISMO → CALL DISEASE_LEAF(SEASINIT)
              │               PUT('PLANT','VPHOTF', VPHOTF_DISMO)
              ├── [RATE]      IF RUN_DISMO → GET weather & LAI via GET/PUT
              │                           → CALL DISEASE_LEAF(RATE)
              │                           → DISLA += DISEASE_LAI_DISMO
              │                           → PUT('PLANT','VPHOTF', VPHOTF_DISMO)
              │               IF PCN > 0  → classic LINDM/PESTCP/SEEDDM/VEGDM/ROOTDM
              ├── [INTEGR]    CALL ASMDM(PGAVL, PPSR, TPSR, VPHOTF_DISMO → ASMDOT)
              │               IF PCN > 0  → SEEDDM / VEGDM / ROOTDM
              └── [OUTPUT/SEASEND]  CALL OPPEST
                              IF RUN_DISMO → CALL DISEASE_LEAF(OUTPUT/SEASEND)
```

**Key design points:**

- **Classic pest routines** (`PESTCP`, `SEEDDM`, `VEGDM`, `ROOTDM`) run at `RATE` only when `PCN > 0`. With `ISWDIS = 'D'` and no FILET loaded, `PCN = 0` and those routines are skipped.
- **`ASMDM`** always runs at `INTEGR`, regardless of `ISWDIS`. It now accepts `VPHOTF_DISMO` as a fourth input and applies the virtual lesion reduction to `PGAVL` before subtracting classic pest assimilate damage.
- **`DISLA`** (cm² m⁻²) is zeroed

## How to Use

### 1. Compilation

1. Clone this repository.
2. In your DSSAT-CSM Visual Studio project, add `DISMO.for` as a source file under the `Plant\Generic-Pest` filter.
   - Register it in `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` and `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj.filters` if not already present.
3. Replace `PEST.for` with the modified version from this repository (in `Plant\Generic-Pest\`).
4. The modified `CROPGRO.for` is already in place — it requires no additional action beyond a clean rebuild.
5. Recompile the full DSSAT-CSM solution.

### 2. Activating DISMO: `ISWDIS = 'D'` in the FILEX

The module is activated by the **`DISES`** field in the `*SIMULATION CONTROLS` section of the DSSAT experiment file (`.SBX`, `.MZX`, or equivalent FILEX):

```
*SIMULATION CONTROLS
...
@N WATER NITRO SYMBI PHOS POTAS DISES TILL  ...
 1 Y     Y     Y     N    N     D     N     ...
```

| `DISES` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `N` | No pest or disease simulation |
| `Y` without the 'disease_parameters.txt'| Classic DSSAT pest module — requires a FILET pest time-series file |

When `ISWDIS = 'Y'` and 'disease_parameters.txt' inside the current simulation directory:
- `CROPGRO.for` calls `PEST` (same entry point as for `'Y'`)
- Inside `PEST.for`, `RUN_DISMO = .TRUE.` activates `DISEASE_LEAF` at every simulation phase
- `IPPROG` is **not** called, so `PCN = 0` and classic coupling-point routines (`PESTCP`, `SEEDDM`, `VEGDM`, `ROOTDM`) are skipped at `RATE` and `INTEGR`
- Weather and LAI data are automatically retrieved inside `PEST` via the DSSAT `GET`/`PUT` exchange mechanism

### 3. Input Files

#### `disease_parameters.txt`

This file contains all pathogen-specific parameters. It is searched in this order:

1. **Current working directory** — the folder from which DSSAT is executed (same location as the `.SBX` experiment file and DSSAT output files)
2. **DSSAT species data path** — resolved at runtime via `PATH('PSD', CONTROL%DSSATP, ...)`, typically `C:\DSSAT48\Soybean\`

If the file is not found in either location, `READ_DISEASE_PARAMETERS` exits silently and parameters retain their default (zero) values, which will suppress all disease dynamics.

**File format:** 5 header/comment lines followed by exactly **one data line** with the parameters in the order below, space-separated:

| # | Parameter | Type | Units | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ID` | CHAR(6) | — | Pathogen identifier code |
| 2 | `VRNAME` | CHAR(20) | — | Pathogen or variant name |
| 3 | `NDS` | REAL | spores m⁻² | Primary dispersed spores per infection cycle |
| 4 | `LESION_S` | REAL | m² | Average area of a single lesion |
| 5 | `KVERHULST` | REAL | — | Carrying capacity per unit LAI (population space) |
| 6 | `RVERHULST` | REAL | d⁻¹ | Logistic intrinsic growth rate |
| 7 | `YMAX` | REAL | 0–1 | Maximum infection rate under optimal conditions |
| 8 | `COF_A` | REAL | — | Infection response coefficient A (LWD sensitivity) |
| 9 | `COF_B` | REAL | — | Infection response coefficient B (LWD shape) |
| 10 | `TMIN_G` | REAL | °C | Minimum temperature for spore germination |
| 11 | `TOT_G` | REAL | °C | Optimum temperature for spore germination |
| 12 | `TMAX_G` | REAL | °C | Maximum temperature for spore germination |
| 13 | `TMIN_D` | REAL | °C | Minimum temperature for fungal development |
| 14 | `TOT_D` | REAL | °C | Optimum temperature for fungal development |
| 15 | `TMAX_D` | REAL | °C | Maximum temperature for fungal development |
| 16 | `LDmin` | REAL | d | Minimum latency period; scales `LR = FT_D / LDmin` |
| 17 | `LESIONAGEOPT` | REAL | 0–1 | Normalised lesion age at peak sporulation |
| 18 | `LESLIFEMAX` | REAL | d | Maximum lesion lifespan; scales aging rate |
| 19 | `DAE_START` | INT | d | Days after emergence when disease becomes active |
| 20 | `beta` | REAL | — | Virtual lesion exponent β; higher = stronger photosynthesis reduction |

#### Internal Switches in `DISMO.for`

Two compile-time `PARAMETER` constants control optional behaviour:

| Constant | Default | Effect when `.TRUE.` |
|---|---|---|
| `USE_FUNGICIDE` | `.FALSE.` | Applies fungicide when `SUM7 >= 6`; reduces `IR` by `FUNG_EFFICIENCY` for 14 days |
| `USE_WTH_RH` | `.TRUE.` | Uses `RH` from the DSSAT weather file directly; when `.FALSE.` computes `RH` from empirical dew-point |

### 4. Output Files

#### `DISMO.OUT`

- **Location:** written to the **current working directory** (same folder as DSSAT output files such as `PLANTGRO.OUT`)
- **When:** file is opened (with `STATUS='replace'`) at `CONTROL%RUN = 1` during `RUNINIT`; one row is written per day at every `OUTPUT` call; the file is **closed** at `SEASEND`
- **Multi-season runs:** a new file is created at the start of each run sequence (file is replaced at `RUN = 1`); subsequent seasons within the same run append rows

| Column | Units | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FILEX` | — | Experiment file name (8 chars) | From `CONTROL%FILEX` |
| `RUN` | — | Simulation run number | From `CONTROL%RUN` |
| `YYDOY` | YYDDD | Current date | e.g. `25031` = year 2025, day 31 |
| `DAS` | d | Days after sowing | From `CONTROL%DAS` |
| `LAI_HEALTH` | m² m⁻² | Healthy LAI at start of day | `LAI_TOTAL − LAI_INF_LIST(prev)`, bounded ≥ 0 |
| `LA_DISEASE` | m² m⁻² | Cumulative diseased/removed LAI | Internally stored as cm² m⁻²; divided by 10 000 for output |
| `LA_INFECT` | m² m⁻² | Instantaneous infectious (sporulating) surface today | Daily total; **not** cumulative; sum across all active cohorts |
| `NEW_LOSS` | m² m⁻² d⁻¹ | Newly activated diseased area today | Summing over all days reconstructs `LA_DISEASE` |
| `LWD` | h | Leaf wetness duration | 0–24 h; derived from `RH` via logistic function |
| `RH` | % | Relative humidity | From weather file (`USE_WTH_RH=.TRUE.`) or computed |
| `FAT_TEMP` | 0–1 | Combined temperature response `FT = FT_G × FT_D` | Used for infection rate |
| `LAI_TOTAL` | m² m⁻² | Total canopy LAI from CROPGRO | Retrieved via `GET('PLANT','XLAID',...)` |
| `SUM7` | 0–21 | 7-day rolling sum of DVIP risk classes | Each day contributes 0–3 |
| `NSPRAYS` | count | Cumulative fungicide applications | Zero if `USE_FUNGICIDE = .FALSE.` |
| `FUNG_ACT` | T / F | Fungicide residual protection active | When `T`, `IR` is reduced by `FUNG_EFFICIENCY` |
| `Severity%` | % | Monotone disease severity | `(LA_DISEASE / LAI_PEAK_SEASON) × 100`; never decreases within a season |

> **Unit note on `DISEASE_LAI`:** the variable is passed from DISMO to PEST as `DISEASE_LAI_DISMO` in **cm² m⁻²**, matching the units of `DISLA` used by `VEGDM` and `GROW`. The output file column `LA_DISEASE` divides by 10 000 to report in m² m⁻².
